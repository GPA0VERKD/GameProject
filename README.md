# David's Personal Game Project
Current working title: ?
This is the repo for my game project, primarily a side hobby I'll be working on for fun.
Initially I will be using python and pygame to make the game, however in the future I'd like to learn C++ and optimize it and possible use a more advanced game engine to make the game more sophisticated/run faster

## Game Idea (Brainstorming)
----- is a top-down pixel art dungeon crawler that utilizes customizable skills and characters for fast-paced combat.
### Main Concepts
#### Main Game
    * Large map sectioned into grids, different mobs at different levels spawn in each
	* Some sections are bosses
	* Free roam, defeat mobs/bosses, absorb characters, level up until able to fight final boss to complete run
	* Runs are scored, replay value in beating high score or arcade modes
	* Pixel art!
#### Player
	* Abilities: dodge, primary, special
	    * Change based on character played/abilities chosen
	* Mobs/gameplay details
	    * Fast paced interactive combat based on timing and special mechanics based on characters!
	* Typing!
	    * Plants: specialized in defense
	    * Fire: specialized in attack
	    * Water: movement based
	    * Neutral: miscellaneous
	    * Fire < water < plant < fire < â€¦, neutral has no typing advantage/disadvantage
#### Character/Ability ideas
